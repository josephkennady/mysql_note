MySQL supports various data types, which can be classified into the following categories:

1. Numeric Data Types:
   - TINYINT: 1-byte signed integer (range -128 to 127)
   - SMALLINT: 2-byte signed integer (range -32,768 to 32,767)
   - MEDIUMINT: 3-byte signed integer (range -8,388,608 to 8,388,607)
   - INT/INTEGER: 4-byte signed integer (range -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
   - BIGINT: 8-byte signed integer (range -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)
   - FLOAT: Single-precision floating-point number
   - DOUBLE: Double-precision floating-point number
   - DECIMAL/NUMERIC: Fixed-point decimal number

2. String Data Types:
   - CHAR: Fixed-length character string (up to 255 characters)
   - VARCHAR: Variable-length character string (up to 65,535 characters)
   - BINARY: Fixed-length binary string (up to 255 bytes)
   - VARBINARY: Variable-length binary string (up to 65,535 bytes)
   - TEXT: Variable-length character string (up to 65,535 characters)
   - BLOB: Variable-length binary string (up to 65,535 bytes)

3. Date and Time Data Types:
   - DATE: Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - TIME: Time (HH:MM:SS)
   - DATETIME: Date and time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
   - TIMESTAMP: Date and time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

4. Other Data Types:
   - BOOLEAN: Boolean value (0 or 1)
   - ENUM: Enumeration (a list of up to 65,535 values)
   - SET: Set of values (a list of up to 64 values)

The size of each data type depends on the number of bytes used to store the data. For example, the size of an INT data type is 4 bytes, while the size of a BIGINT data type is 8 bytes.

The choice of data type depends on the type of data being stored and the expected size of the data. For example, if a column is expected to store only positive integers up to 255, a TINYINT data type can be used to save space. On the other hand, if a column needs to store large integers, a BIGINT data type can be used. Similarly, if a column needs to store a fixed number of decimal places, a DECIMAL data type can be used instead of FLOAT or DOUBLE to avoid rounding errors.
